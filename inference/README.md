## Inference Demo

This directory contains a lightweight inference script demonstrating the MedideepCF pipeline.

### Script

- `run_demo.py`  
  Executes segmentation, classification, and severity estimation on a single input image using pretrained models.

### Intended Use

The script is provided for:
- Verifying model compatibility
- Demonstrating end-to-end inference flow
- Supporting qualitative evaluation

### Note

This demo focuses on clarity and reproducibility rather than optimized deployment.
